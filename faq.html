          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <h3>What does “raw honey” mean?</h3>
          <p>
            Raw honey is never overheated and not ultra-filtered, so it keeps
            more of its natural flavor, aroma, and character.
          </p>

          <h3>Why does honey taste a little different through the year?</h3>
          <p>
            Honey reflects what the bees forage each season. Weather, bloom
            timing, and local flowers all shape color and flavor.
          </p>

          <h3>Why did my honey crystallize?</h3>
          <p>
            Crystallization is natural and a sign of real honey. Many people
            love the thick consistency, but if you want to soften your honey,
            warm it gently around 95–100&deg;F. Do not microwave and do not boil.
          </p>

          <h3>How should I store honey?</h3>
          <p>
            Keep it sealed at room temperature in a dry place. Honey lasts a
            very long time when stored well.
          </p>

          <h3>How does local pickup work?</h3>
          <p>
            Email your order, then I’ll confirm what’s available and set pickup
            details. We meet locally for handoff in Batavia/Corfu/Western NY
            areas.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you offer shipping yet?</h3>
          <p>
            Not at this time for most items, but options are growing as the
            shop expands.
          </p>

          <h3>Is online checkout available now?</h3>
          <p>Online checkout is coming soon.</p>
