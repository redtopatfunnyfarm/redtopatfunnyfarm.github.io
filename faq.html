          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <h3>What does raw mean?</h3>
          <p>
            Raw honey is never overheated and not ultra-filtered, so it keeps
            more of its natural flavor, aroma, and character.
          </p>

          <h3>Why does honey vary by season?</h3>
          <p>
            Each harvest reflects what the bees were visiting. Different blooms,
            weather, and timing naturally change color, texture, and taste.
          </p>

          <h3>Why did my honey crystallize?</h3>
          <p>
            Crystallization is natural in real honey. Some people prefer the
            thick consistency, but if you want to soften your honey, warm it
            gently around 95–100&deg;F. Avoid microwaving or boiling.
          </p>

          <h3>How should I store honey?</h3>
          <p>
            Keep it sealed at room temperature in a dry spot out of direct sun.
            With proper storage, honey keeps very well.
          </p>

          <h3>How does ordering work?</h3>
          <p>
            Text/call or email your order, I confirm availability, and we set a
            local pickup handoff.
          </p>

          <h3>Where are pickups?</h3>
          <p>
            I currently meet in Batavia, Corfu, and nearby Western NY areas.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you offer shipping?</h3>
          <p>
            Not for most products right now. I’m keeping things local while I
            grow.
          </p>

          <h3>Is online checkout available now?</h3>
          <p>Online checkout is coming soon.</p>
